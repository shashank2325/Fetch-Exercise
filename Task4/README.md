## 1. Choice of Pre-trained Model

For this implementation, I chose **BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5** as our pre-trained model based on:
- Strong performance on semantic textual similarity and retrieval tasks
- Robust sentence embedding capabilities
- Compatibility with our multi-task learning architecture
- Initial testing showing better out-of-box performance for our specific classification tasks

The BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 model provides high-quality embeddings that serve as an excellent foundation for both of our tasks. When testing the untrained model, it showed promising initial results with some correct predictions even before fine-tuning, suggesting good alignment with our task requirements.# Task 4: Training Loop Implementation (BONUS)

This document summarizes the key decisions and insights related to the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) training loop implementation. The implementation focuses on handling hypothetical data, managing the forward pass, computing appropriate loss functions, and tracking relevant metrics for multi-task learning.

## Key Components and Design Decisions

### 1. Multi-Task Dataset Implementation

The `MTLDataset` class is designed to handle the unique challenges of multi-task learning data:

- **Flexible Label Availability**: Supports samples that may have labels for one, both, or neither task
- **Sample Tracking**: Maintains metadata about which tasks are available for each sample
- **Balanced Representation**: Provides statistics about task distribution to inform training strategies
- **Efficient Tokenization**: Handles tokenization during dataset creation to avoid redundant processing

**Rationale**: This design addresses a key challenge in MTL - dealing with datasets where not all samples have labels for all tasks. It allows us to leverage all available data while maintaining awareness of the task distribution.

### 2. Training Strategy and Loss Computation

The `MTLTrainer` class implements several strategic decisions:

- **Task Weighting**: Configurable weights for task-specific losses enable balancing task importance
- **Dynamic Loss Composition**: Only computes losses for tasks that have labels in the current batch
- **Optional Embedding Regularization**: Framework for adding contrastive learning or other embedding-specific losses
- **Gradient Aggregation**: Single backward pass on combined loss for parameter efficiency

**Rationale**: This approach ensures that the model learns effectively from all available data without biasing toward any particular task, while providing flexibility to adjust the relative importance of tasks.

### 3. Training and Evaluation Loops

The implementation includes detailed training and evaluation loops with:

- **Per-Task Metrics**: Separate tracking of loss and accuracy for each task
- **Detailed Progress Monitoring**: Rich progress information during training
- **Task-Specific Evaluation**: Metrics calculated separately for each task during validation
- **Checkpointing**: Regular model saving to enable resumption and prevent lost progress

**Rationale**: Separate metric tracking is crucial for multi-task models, as overall performance can mask issues with individual tasks. The detailed monitoring helps identify when tasks are competing or not learning effectively.

### 4. Task Sampling Strategies

The code includes a framework for implementing task sampling strategies:

- **Comment Blocks**: Demonstrate how to implement task sampling during training
- **Flexible Task Selection**: Infrastructure for random task selection or other sampling strategies
- **Batch-Level Task Decisions**: Allows for dynamic decisions based on batch composition

**Rationale**: Task sampling can help address imbalances between tasks and prevent dominant tasks from overwhelming the learning process. The flexible approach allows tailoring the strategy to specific dataset characteristics.

## Key Insights and Considerations

### 1. Task Balance Challenges

A critical insight from developing this training loop is the inherent tension between tasks in multi-task learning:

- **Gradient Interference**: Updates beneficial for one task may harm another
- **Representation Dominance**: Shared representations may become biased toward dominant tasks
- **Loss Scale Differences**: Raw losses for different tasks may have drastically different scales

**Solution**: The implementation addresses these challenges through configurable loss weights, careful metric tracking, and the infrastructure for task sampling strategies.

### 2. Efficient Processing Considerations

The implementation makes several efficiency-focused decisions:

- **Batched Processing**: All operations are designed for batch processing
- **Memory Management**: Careful handling of device placement and tensor movement
- **Computation Reuse**: Shared forward pass for multiple tasks when possible

**Rationale**: These optimizations are crucial for making multi-task learning computationally feasible, especially with large transformer models.

### 3. Monitoring and Debugging Support

The training loop includes extensive support for monitoring and debugging:

- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of training progress and metrics
- **Progress Visualization**: Framework for tracking and visualizing metrics during training
- **Checkpoint Management**: Regular saving of model state and training statistics

**Rationale**: Multi-task learning adds complexity that makes monitoring and debugging more challenging. These features help identify issues early and understand model behavior.

## Assumptions and Limitations

1. **Equal Batch Sizes**: The implementation assumes that we can use the same batch size for all tasks, which may not be optimal if tasks have very different data characteristics.

2. **Hard Parameter Sharing Only**: The current implementation only supports hard parameter sharing architecture. Soft parameter sharing would require significant modifications.

3. **No Curriculum Learning**: The implementation doesn't currently support curriculum strategies where task difficulty progressively increases.

4. **Hypothetical Data Only**: As specified in the assignment, the implementation uses hypothetical data rather than real-world datasets.

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that could be extended with:

1. **Dynamic Loss Weighting**: Automatically adjusting task weights based on validation performance
2. **Task Curriculum Strategies**: Implementing progressive task introduction during training
3. **Uncertainty-Based Weighting**: Using uncertainty estimates to dynamically weight tasks
4. **Gradient Manipulation**: Adding capabilities for gradient surgery to reduce task interference
5. **Distributed Training Support**: Extending the implementation for multi-GPU or distributed training

These enhancements would further improve the flexibility and performance of the multi-task learning system.

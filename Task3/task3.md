Task 3: Training Considerations
Freezing Scenarios Analysis
1. Entire Network Frozen
Implications and Advantages:

Zero Learning: The model becomes a fixed feature extractor with no parameter updates.
Computational Efficiency: Forward passes only, no backpropagation required.
Consistency: Predictions remain stable across all inputs.
No Catastrophic Forgetting: Preserves all pre-trained knowledge.

Disadvantages:

No Adaptation: Cannot adapt to domain-specific patterns or task requirements.
Limited Performance: Performance ceiling is determined by pre-training quality and task similarity.

Rationale: This approach is only suitable when:

The pre-trained model already performs exceptionally well on the target tasks
You need absolute consistency in predictions
You're dealing with extreme computational constraints
You want to establish a performance baseline before fine-tuning

2. Only Transformer Backbone Frozen
Implications and Advantages:

Representational Stability: Core language representations remain fixed while task-specific heads adapt.
Efficient Training: Far fewer parameters to update (typically >90% reduction).
Reduced Overfitting: Limited parameter space prevents overfitting on small datasets.
Knowledge Preservation: Retains pre-trained language knowledge.

Disadvantages:

Representational Limitations: Fixed embeddings may not capture task-specific nuances.
Feature Mismatch: Pre-trained features might not be optimal for specific downstream tasks.

Rationale: This approach works well when:

You have limited training data
The pre-trained model's domain is similar to your target domain
You want to avoid overfitting
Computational resources are limited
Quick iteration is needed

3. One Task-Specific Head Frozen
Implications and Advantages:

Knowledge Transfer: The frozen head can guide the learning of the other head through shared encoder.
Regularization Effect: The frozen head acts as a constraint for the shared encoder optimization.
Task Prioritization: You can prioritize learning for the unfrozen task while maintaining performance on the frozen task.

Disadvantages:

Suboptimal for Both Tasks: Neither task can fully adapt the shared representations.
Imbalanced Performance: The frozen task may underperform compared to the adaptable task.

Rationale: This approach is beneficial when:

One task is already well-optimized while the other needs improvement
You want to incrementally add tasks without disrupting existing capabilities
The frozen task serves as a regularizer for the unfrozen task
One task has significantly less training data than the other

Transfer Learning Approach
1. Choice of Pre-trained Model
I recommend using NovaSearch/stella_en_1.5B_v5 as our pre-trained model for these reasons:

Strong performance on the MTEB benchmark, indicating high-quality sentence embeddings
Reasonable size (1.5B parameters) balancing performance and computational efficiency
Optimized for sentence-level tasks, aligning well with our classification objectives
Support for multiple embedding dimensions, allowing flexibility in the feature space

2. Layered Freezing/Unfreezing Strategy
I propose a progressive unfreezing approach:
Stage 1: Task-Specific Head Training

Freeze the entire transformer backbone
Train only the task-specific classification heads
Purpose: Establish baseline task performance with fixed representations

Stage 2: Top Layer Unfreezing

Keep most of the transformer frozen
Unfreeze the top 2-3 transformer layers and the projection layer
Continue training task-specific heads
Purpose: Allow shallow adaptation of representations while preserving core language knowledge

Stage 3: Discriminative Fine-tuning

Apply graduated learning rates to different layers (lower for early layers, higher for later layers)
Unfreeze more layers progressively
Purpose: Allow deeper adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting

Stage 4 (Optional): Full Fine-tuning

Unfreeze all parameters with very small learning rate
Purpose: Final optimization if computational resources allow

3. Rationale for This Approach
This progressive unfreezing strategy is optimal because:

Parameter Efficiency: Initially training only task-specific heads (few parameters) achieves quick adaptation.
Knowledge Preservation: Keeping lower layers frozen preserves fundamental language understanding.
Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention: Graduated learning rates prevent losing pre-trained knowledge.
Computational Efficiency: Training progressively from a few to more parameters allows stopping early if performance plateaus.
Multi-Task Balance: This approach helps balance learning between tasks without one dominating the shared representations.
Adaptability: The granular control allows adjusting the strategy based on monitoring task performance during training.
Empirical Success: Similar approaches have proven effective in related NLP transfer learning scenarios.
